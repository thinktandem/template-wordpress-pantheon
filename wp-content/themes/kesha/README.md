This site uses an atomic design type structure for it's SaSS.

**Setup**

```
cd path/of/child-theme
npm i
grunt
```

**CSS**

In the ```assets/style``` folder is where all the magic happens.  If you add files to the asset structure, don't forget to include them in the ```assets/style/main.scss``` file.

**JS**

All the JS goes in the ```assets/js``` folder. If you add more JS files, remember to add them to the themeJs variable in Gruntfile.js.
